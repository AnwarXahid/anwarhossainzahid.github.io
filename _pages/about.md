People call me **Zahid**, but I prefer to think of thyself as nameless and ageless entity who is 
mesmerised by the ever-lasting beauty of the mother nature. However, in the sense of spatial domain, 
My consciousness emerged and developed in a very native land of Bangladesh. I grew up in the suburb 
and then came to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, for better education. I completed my graduation 
from BUET, but I've been feeling thirsty for knowledge ever before. In the long run, I want to get
absolute profundity. Currently, I'm working in the Software Industry, and looking forward to start 
my journey as an aspirant researcher. <br>

Besides computer science, I have interest in history, religion, and philosophy. Reading something is 
like drinking water to me, I can't live without read and think. I am a very good actor,
[lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmC-O1CBsV4&t=631s), and I like to play guitar. Music gives me 
absolute tranquillity. <br>

If you are doing or thinking of some impossible task and looking for some partner, feel free to contact
me. Have a nice day.
